CourSysToEclipse
================
Utility for preparing assignment submissions downloaded from SFU CourSys to easily importable Eclipse projects. CourSysToEclipse recursively extracts the zip file, renames all the folders, and renames all the .project files to contain the student/group id and the assignment name. The resulting folder contains all the submissions with a consistent naming scheme and can easily be imported into Eclipse.
